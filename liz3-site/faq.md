# General

## Favorite Music direction
Anything EDM, i have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfioCKj5VJmzcoCZ13trHGw" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a> where i upload EDM stuff from time to time.

## Tea or Coffee
Coffee all the way.

## Why no instagram or Facebook
Facebook is highly privacy intruding and privacy matters more then most people think.

# Coding stuff
## Favorite language
Js(ES6), Go and Kotlin.
## Coding editor/IDE
GNU Emacs for all web related and 99% other stuff. VS Code or jetbrains if a big refactor is needed or any other special case.

scss.
## Frameworks
For smaller projects none, otherwise: React/Redux, i don't usually use anything ui wise, custom css ftw.
